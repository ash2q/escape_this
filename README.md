# Synopsis
You are spiderbot, a bot which has awoken in a post apocalyptic world. Your operative is to retrievea core sample from anactive reactor. the reactor is available from the start. However, there is little chance of survival without upgrades to your hardware. So, you must find resources in the lab. the further you dive into the lab, the better the resources but also the harder the enemies. The reactor has modifiers such as extra heat from radiation and contains extra hard enemies

The specific "niche" that makes this game different is the concept of "heat" and being able to get movement mods, such as "dash". Due to heat, the ideal strategy is NOT to hold down the fire button continously. Instead, it should be pulsed carefully. Your guns can become overheated which will make them do more damage, but if your guns are overheated for too long, then spiderbot becomes overheated. When overheated, it's exterior shell is much less durable, causing a 2x increase in damage. This system can be modified by modules, such as having a radiator module which dissipates heat from spiderbot more empty. Once overheated, you must wait until it cools down to 0 before the weakened shell effect goes away.

# Equipment

Spider bot has a series of modules such as a primary weapon, a secondary special weapon, and a movement "dodge" (or whatever). At first you start with no modules and only a basic primary weapon. Different weapons come with different compromises. Specifically there is a heat meter which must be constantly worried about, you can't just hold down the fire button. If you do hold the fire button down too long, the gun will heat up. As it does, it may do more damage than normally, but there is a fine line (which is not something the HUD can provide info for) between overheating your guns, and overheating your entire bot. When the bot is overheated you take double damage. The amount of damage increase for a heated gun depends on the gun. 

# Modules
Home is the only place where modules can be swapped. Home in this case is a cave with a wrench which the spiderbot can use to modify itself. 

Modules include:
* passive movement(1)
* passive shield(1)
* passive frame(1)
* active weapon(1, x)
* active special(1, z)
* active movement(1, x+z)

If no module is equipped, then new modules will be automatically equipped. Most are purely useful, though some come with minor compromises or changes to gameplay. 


# The Lab

The lab is a random generated rogue like environment. Enemies and structure (walls) are random and vary depending on the depth you're at. It is possible to search the same level twice, you are given an option upon trying to enter the lab.

At the end of each stage you are presented with a vending machine. The vending machine contains rarer loot and at cheaper prices than the mechanic shop in the world map. However, it is random (and varying on depth and rarity) as to what the machine will contain. 3 things will be available.

Bolts are the currency which is used in this world, and each enemy destroyed will drop a number of them

# The Reactor

The reactor is a fixed environemnt full of very hard enemies and there are various modifiers placed on the gameplay such as extra heat susceptibility from radiation within. You have a time limit before your electronics decompose from the radiation. 

There are 3 stages to the reactor. The final stage contains a boss. If you defeat the boss then it drops the core sample that your programming requires you to desire and you win the game. 

# Mechanics Shop

The mechanics shop contains a few modules. As you venture deeper into the lab, additional modules will be added. The mechanics shop is quite expensive, but given it is a fixed set of guaranteed to be very useful modules, for some runs it can be very useful.

# Death

There is a health meter for your bot. This health meter is restored each time you're back at the main map. It can be increased through certain modules, and a shield can be added on top of it. 

Upon death, the game resets and all progress is lost. (Maybe) if the game is beaten, then there could be permanent upgrades, such as a basic buffs to damage and movement speed, but I doubt I'll get that far.
